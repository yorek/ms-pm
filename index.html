            Hey my name is Matthew Roche. I'm a program manager at Microsoft and in this video I'd like to talk to you
            about exactly what that means, or at least what it has meant to me. Let's see where it takes us.
          </p>

            I'm recording this video because a week or two ago a friend of mine reached out and he asked if could you
            record a video talking about what it means to be a technical PM at Microsoft. My initial reaction was:
            "Well, technically in my current role I'm not really a standard technical PM. And anyway what a PM means
            really depends a lot on the group it you're in, and the products that you're shipping"...and it was around
            at
            this point that I realized this is probably what he wanted me to talk about in the video.

            Some background on me. I've been with Microsoft for a little bit under 12 years I joined in 2008 and I've
            worked
            on a variety of different products primarily around Business Intelligence and Enterprise Information
            Management.
            Think SQL Server or think Azure and think Power BI, where I am today. The commonality between these
            different
            roles and these different teams is that Microsoft has some of the most interesting problems to solve. One of
            the
            things that I love about being a program manager of Microsoft is I know that my day-to-day work improves the
            lives of
            millions of people around the world. Obviously every day doesn't it make a huge difference for all of those
            millions but
            the products that I've worked on and the features that I've shipped and the ways that I have helped other
            people that
            I've worked with do their jobs and ship their features and support their customers better. The fact that
            we're
            building things as part of Microsoft and we're shipping features as part of Microsoft products and services
            it
            means
            that our day to day work does make a real difference for real people around the world.

          As a program manager the
          primary responsibility of the role is to
          represent the voice of the customer
          even though program managers can and do
          write code they can and do communication
          both inbound and outbound communication
          the most important thing that a program
          manager will do is to represent the
          needs of the customer so that as the
          features are being built and tested and
          shipped and supported by the engineering
          team that works with the program manager
          at every point along the way the program
          manager is representing why we're doing
          what we're doing how it's important how
          it will be used and ensuring that that
          customer perspective that the voice and
          the needs of the customer are
          represented every step along the way if
          we think about what the program
          management discipline entails even
          though there's probably as many answers
          to this as there are program managers at
          Microsoft a wise man told me years ago
          and to be fair a wise man told someone
          that I was working with and that person
          told me well we'll go back to the
          original wise person the wise person
          once said that a program manager is part
          developer so if we you know picture the
          top of the triangle here part developer
          because the program manager needs to
          have an informed technical perspective
          even though a program manager is
          unlikely to be writing code that
          actually ships as part of their product
          it's very common for program managers to
          do prototype code or proof-of-concept
          code or at the bare minimum to be able
          to understand what it is that their
          developers the engineers that are
          shipping and rewriting and shipping the
          features what it is that they're doing
          to implement the features that the
          program manager has envisioned without
          that deep technical foundation the
          program manager would be challenged in
          those engineering or architectural
          conversations even if you're not doing
          the work you need to understand that
          technical work that's being done and if
          we look at that triangle go back to that
          triangle of the program management
          discipline if development or engineering
          is one aspect project management is
          another now this is a key part of the
          job because as you're going from start
          to finish as you're defining and end
          designing and shipping new capabilities
          you need to have the rigor and the
          discipline to ensure that the things
          that need to be done are being done that
          they're being validated that they have
          the right quality and in order to do
          that a lot of the role of the program
          manager
          comes down to that organization and
          discipline that is traditional for
          project managers it's important to state
          you don't need to be a rock star project
          manager you don't need to be super
          organized to be very successful as a
          program manager but you do need to have
          these skills in order to succeed and the
          third aspect of those the triumvirate of
          skills the triangle view of a program
          manager is communication now when this
          was originally shared with me they'd
          actually said not communication but
          marketing they said to me or my friend
          said to me you're part engineer your
          part project manager and you're part
          marketer and this comes down to the fact
          that you need the ability to communicate
          the importance of your feature the value
          the impact that your feature will have
          but marketing is just one specific type
          of communication a successful program
          manager needs to be able to listen to
          what customers need to understand not
          just what they're asking for but why
          they're asking to understand that the
          pain that they're feeling because they
          don't have your of your your incredible
          new future feature and and how you can
          design and deliver a feature that's part
          of a product that doesn't only solve one
          person or one customers problems but it
          solves a category of problems that can
          have a large impact for a greater number
          of people in different scenarios so if
          we think about what the program
          management discipline or the program
          management role is in some ways it's the
          combination of software development
          project management and communication and
          depending on the individual PM depending
          on the team that they're on and
          depending on where they are on a given
          project or effort the importance of
          these different skills or criteria will
          change over time and on each of these
          dimensions now for me personally the
          greatest joy of being a program manager
          is being able to see
          thing end-to-end now as a program
          manager I have the ability first and
          foremost to engage with customers to
          understand their problems
          so before I start coming up with ideas
          for things to do I want to talk to
          customers through you know there's
          there's lots of channels that are
          available so don't stress the details
          here just yet it will vary from team to
          team but I can talk to customers and
          understand what they're doing today
          where they're their current tasks and
          their current tools are frustrating to
          them how much time they're wasting or
          how much workarounds they're doing to
          work around the challenges or the gaps
          in the current product with a current
          process and based on all of this
          understanding of the problem I can start
          to hypothesize what a solution looks
          like and this is very iterative but I
          can essentially talk to customers to see
          where they're struggling I can get
          deeper information about what the actual
          opportunity is and with that I can have
          an informed idea about the solution
          before I build it I'll go back and I'll
          validate it with those customers and
          probably with other customers as well to
          make sure that it is generalizable and
          our understanding of the problem is
          complete enough to ship something once
          that's done we'll come up with a design
          and the program manager will work with
          developers and architects to come up
          with both a functional spec and a
          technical spec so we basically have what
          the solution or what the feature will
          look like and then the program manager
          will work with the developers and the
          architects as well to actually guide the
          implementation end to end so there will
          always be questions that need that
          customer perspective that the PM
          represents and making sure that from the
          time we have the idea to the time that
          we design a solution to the time that
          the implementation is complete it's the
          program managers responsibility at each
          step along the way to ensure that
          everyone knows why we're doing it and
          how customers will get value from it how
          is it going to be
          the program manager will make sure that
          the feature the new capability the
          product is ready for release and as part
          of that readiness process this may
          involve things like documentation it may
          involve things like having focus groups
          or running a private preview to get
          early customers evaluating and kicking
          the tires and providing feedback to make
          sure not only does it say what the
          developers say that it will do but also
          that it does what the customers needed
          to do to solve the problems that it was
          designed to solve and once that feature
          is available a new product is shipped or
          a new feature or capability is added to
          a service through the ongoing release
          cycle it's the program managers joy it's
          the program managers responsibility to
          also evangelize and to make sure that
          people know here's the thing that we've
          shipped stop doing things the old way or
          if you had this problem now you can have
          this new solution to it part of this
          will be in feature but for me this could
          often involve things like user groups or
          webcasts or conference presentations
          being a program manager even though it
          can be a very technical role and you're
          working with all you know a bunch of
          other geeks building and shipping these
          exciting things if you're interested in
          a more public aspect to the role there's
          always an opportunity for people who are
          strong on the communication side to go
          out there and to represent their
          products on stage in front of dozens or
          hundreds or thousands of people and it's
          you know for people that are interested
          in such things it's a great opportunity
          one aspect of shipping products as a
          Microsoft p.m. I mentioned earlier that
          it's that you're making lives better
          you're making the the your you're
          improving the lives of many people
          around the world a corollary of this or
          another aspect of this is that people
          care about what you're doing being a
          p.m. at Microsoft you can also be the
          public face of your features
          and this means that when you blog when
          you have a webcast or a podcast or other
          public communication there's an audience
          out there that is eager to know what
          you're doing what you're working on and
          how would the thing that you shipped can
          work and that community aspect of things
          can be very fulfilling and validating as
          well as with many things the program
          management role comes down to people and
          process and technology but at least in
          my experience the people aspect of being
          a program manager is really at the core
          of things you work with customers to
          understand their problems and what would
          need to happen to solve those problems
          you work with engineers to make sure
          that you're building and shipping
          features that solve the problems but do
          it in a technically efficient well
          performing cost-effective way you may
          work with designers that will that will
          build a user interface that is intuitive
          and useful and flows in his modern you
          work with fellow program managers you're
          never working in isolation you're always
          part of the team with people that will
          support you and compliment you and help
          you grow in your career and you're
          working with other teams as well even
          though this is something that you do
          more as you are more senior in your
          career working with people from other
          teams or other orgs or other parts of
          Microsoft it's a huge opportunity and
          even though you will start with one team
          so you start on one team working on one
          product typically at Microsoft after two
          or three years you'll you will have
          solved the problems that you came in to
          solve you've shipped the features that
          you are that you came in to ship so
          you've come in you've made a difference
          you've grown once you've solved the
          problems for today Microsoft has this
          amazing field of opportunity where you
          can look around and find other problems
          and other teams and that work that
          you've done the cross team work that
          you've done shipping your first set or
          your next set of features and
          capabilities it allows you to build
          relationships and friendships to find
          where your
          next opportunity will be and even though
          this sounds I sound like a recruiter as
          I listen to myself that sounds like a
          pitch my experience has been very much
          like that where as I moved from role to
          role and from work to org it's the
          people that I worked with three years
          ago or five years ago or ten years ago
          that I find myself working with again on
          new products under new leaders shipping
          new things and it always comes back to
          who are the customers because the people
          the process and the technology the
          customers are always the most important
          people let's go back to the beginning of
          the video so the reason that I'm here in
          front of the camera with the lights and
          the microphone is because my friend
          Christopher reached out to me and he
          basically said it's like hey we're
          looking for a video what it's like to be
          a tech PM now imagine you were about to
          graduate from college what would you
          want to know and the first thing that I
          thought of there was well I've never
          graduated from college so how would I
          know that right so I do not have a
          degree I've been with Microsoft for
          around 12 years I've been in industry
          for about 25 but I was a lousy student
          so if you are coming to Microsoft with a
          degree with a CS or other degree you'll
          definitely have a step up but what I
          wanted to do was I wanted to reach out
          to people on my team or on teams that I
          worked with on a regular basis to make
          sure that it wasn't just my voice being
          reflected so let's actually head over to
          teams and see what a few of my peers had
          to say about their experience as PMS at
          Microsoft let's see
          right so when I was done filming the
          last section of the videos when I was
          done filming my part I reached out to
          two members of the power bi team I
          reached out to Tessa and I reached out
          to wills there at different stages of
          their career with different roles and
          responsibilities but they're both
          program managers and I asked them three
          basic questions so the first one I asked
          was what do you do as a p.m. at
          Microsoft so I didn't say what the
          question meant but basically what what
          do you do I look after a particular
          particular set of features in a future
          area most of my role since we are a
          product team is that we work with as a
          p.m. I work with engineers designers
          user researchers and data scientists and
          talk to customers and try to synthesize
          all of this information to better
          understand the functional spec of a
          future and in addition to this part of
          that figuring out what the function spec
          looks like is also taking to account
          costs and timelines and figuring out
          what milestones you can deliver a
          feature in incremental e so they can get
          early user feedback and get customers
          working with parts of a solution as you
          drive the more complete feature to
          production so I am what's called a group
          program manager which means I manage a
          surpise I'm team leader or they were put
          to me and my specific area is a tool
          called power bi desktop which is a tool
          for people to bring data together build
          visualizations analyze their data and
          find interesting insights in that data
          and so my day-to-day role it's partly
          supervisory in that I've got other
          people who are doing lots of the detail
          work but I do get to do some of that as
          well and for a p.m. that means often
          sitting in meetings and debating with
          other people other engineers or
          designers or whoever they might be how
          best do we go and you know
          design a feature build a feature to to
          serve whatever request it is that's
          coming in from our customers and so for
          me that means thinking about what does a
          customer me at need and deciding how's
          this feature gonna work when I click on
          this button what is he gonna do
          you know if if something goes wrong how
          we're gonna tell the use of it goes
          wrong what does it say in those error
          messages you know what what what things
          do we put on a screen for somebody to
          click on the or drag or interact with to
          helps them analyze that data helps them
          find insights in that data so the second
          question that I asked was what is the
          most important skill behavior or
          practice that makes you successful as a
          program manager at Microsoft I think
          it's hard to limit it down to one
          particular skill or one that would be
          more important than others I think some
          of the common ones that people talk
          about are having clear communication and
          being organized but as I feel like I
          start to settle into the role more
          sometimes I feel like the most important
          skill at the point in time can vary
          depending on where I am in the life
          cycle of different projects but some
          things that I've been thinking about
          more recently are being flexible as far
          as come up or plans change in your
          semester planning and another thing I've
          been thinking about law is as PMS we do
          have a lot of meetings with different
          sometimes context switching can be a
          little bit difficult and I definitely
          think it's a skill to practice and get
          we're used to so personally I think the
          one that makes the biggest difference is
          empathy having empathy for your
          customers and your users and really
          being able to understand how do I spend
          time with those users and those
          customers to be able to understand what
          drives them in their work you know what
          is or in their usage of my product you
          know may not be a business scenario
          might be consumer product to
          it's about understanding what are they
          trying to achieve with this bit of
          technology that they're using is it that
          they want to just click some buttons get
          a result and go home is it that they
          won't use this technology to make a
          connection with another person somewhere
          is it that they want to use the
          technology to you know change something
          in the way that they do business with
          their customers understanding what are
          those goals that those those users have
          got and then being able to empathize
          with the other constraints they have on
          their time or the skill set or you know
          the environment that they're working in
          you know whether they're there's
          somebody sitting at a desk working at a
          PC or whether they're out on a mobile
          device somewhere or whether they're
          sitting on a couch
          you know using something from from 20
          feet away you know being able to really
          understand all of those yeah constraints
          um requirements that users have and
          being able to translate that into how
          best do we build a product and build
          features to to help them in the third
          question that I asked was if you could
          go back in time if you could go back and
          tell one thing - you're about to
          graduate from college self if you could
          go back to your past self and tell them
          one thing about being a program manager
          at Microsoft what would it be so
          Microsoft has a ton of smart people who
          know more than you do and I've been
          working on your product even before it
          was a product and if I could go back and
          tell myself that one thing it would
          probably still be to push myself to ask
          more questions and err on the side of
          giving and receiving over explanations
          to make sure that everyone is on the
          same page when you're working with other
          teams and when you're in meetings and on
          the other side everyone is definitely
          very busy and is working hard so people
          are generally pretty open with sharing
          their knowledge and taking the time to
          chat with you and make sure that you
          have a better understanding of the of
          the scope and the area so something that
          somebody somebody told me many many many
          many years ago that really really stuck
          was about choosing the energy levels
          that you bring to work we did this weird
          felt very Airy fairy at the time
          exercise where there's a bunch of us you
          know going through some introductory
          training we got given the card randomly
          have a normal deck of cards and they
          said okay we're gonna do some little
          presentations or whatever you can talk
          about whatever topic you want something
          you're interested and what you have a
          dinner last night whatever it was but
          match your energy levels to the value
          that you chose on your card or that you
          got given on your card so if you've got
          a two or three doing really kind of
          low-energy and don't panic don't be
          excited and if you've got one of the
          picture cards you got like a king or a
          queen whatever it is you're doing right
          and the card that you choose determines
          it so we do this thing and I got a jack
          so I'm like okay that's pretty good high
          level of energy but not over-the-top and
          I realized that that applies in all of
          my work day to day that I can choose how
          much energy I'm putting in even if I've
          had a really rubbish day and I've had a
          really hard time getting my head around
          whatever problem is we're trying to
          solve I can still come to work choose it
          to be energetic if I need to be and
          there's a balance right because
          sometimes you want to make take a more
          measured approach and you want to get a
          point across in the way that you're
          explaining what you do or explaining
          what feedback you've got from a customer
          where you want to be a bit more measured
          and being able to choose and swap
          between those was a really useful skill
          developed quite early on and if I'd been
          able to you know hit that hour they hear
          that from kind of day one being a p.m. I
          think that would have helped me be more
          successful
          I hope this has been useful if you have
          any additional questions about being a
          program manager at Microsoft please put
          them into the comments below can't wait
          to hear what you think and once you join
          Microsoft please look me up love to talk
          to you
