## Why this content?

I (Davide) have been asked thousand times what means to be a PM in Microsoft and exactly what a PM do. My friend Matthew Roche recorded what is in my opinion the best and most complete answer possible, and so I though it could be helpful to make that answer even more accessible and discoverable by anyone interested. 

## Why a GitHub repo?

It's all about collaboration. Matthew did the recording, I put together the website. If you think this website can be improved in any way, and you can help with that (a better design, some cool drawings, nicer javascript effects...whatever), please contribute. Fork, submit a PR and help the community :)
