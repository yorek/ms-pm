## Intro
Hey my name is Matthew Roche. I'm a program manager at Microsoft, and in this video I'd like to talk to you about exactly what that means, or at least what it has meant to me. Let's see where it takes us.

## Why I'm recoding this video
I'm recording this video because a week or two ago a friend of mine reached out and he asked if could you record a video talking about what it means to be a technical PM at Microsoft. My initial reaction was: "Well, technically in my current role I'm not really a standard technical PM. And anyway what a PM means
really depends a lot on the group it you're in, and the products that you're shipping"...and it was around at this point that I realized this is probably what he wanted me to talk about in the video.

## Who I Am
Some background on me. I've been with Microsoft for a little bit under 12 years I joined in 2008 and I've worked on a variety of different products primarily around Business Intelligence and Enterprise Information Management. Think SQL Server or think Azure and think Power BI, where I am today. The commonality between these different roles and these different teams is that Microsoft has some of the most interesting problems to solve.

## Why I am a Program Manager
One of the things that I love about being a program manager of Microsoft is I know that my day-to-day work improves the lives of millions of people around the world. Obviously every day doesn't it make a huge difference for all of those millions but the products that I've worked on, and the features that I've shipped, and the ways that I have helped other people that I've worked with do their jobs and ship their features and support their customers better - the fact that we're building things as part of Microsoft and we're shipping features as part of Microsoft products and services - it means that our day to day work does make a real difference for real people around the world.
