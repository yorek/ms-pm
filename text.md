## Intro
Hey my name is Matthew Roche. I'm a program manager at Microsoft, and in this video I'd like to talk to you about exactly what that means, or at least what it has meant to me. Let's see where it takes us.

## Why I'm recoding this video
I'm recording this video because a week or two ago a friend of mine reached out and he asked if could you record a video talking about what it means to be a technical PM at Microsoft. My initial reaction was: "Well, technically in my current role I'm not really a standard technical PM. And anyway what a PM means
really depends a lot on the group it you're in, and the products that you're shipping"...and it was around at this point that I realized this is probably what he wanted me to talk about in the video.

## Who I Am
Some background on me. I've been with Microsoft for a little bit under 12 years I joined in 2008 and I've worked on a variety of different products primarily around Business Intelligence and Enterprise Information Management. Think SQL Server or think Azure and think Power BI, where I am today. The commonality between these different roles and these different teams is that Microsoft has some of the most interesting problems to solve.

## Why I am a Program Manager
One of the things that I love about being a program manager of Microsoft is I know that my day-to-day work improves the lives of millions of people around the world. Obviously every day doesn't it make a huge difference for all of those millions, but the products that I've worked on, and the features that I've shipped, and the ways that I have helped other people that I've worked with, do their jobs and ship their features and support their customers better, the fact that we're building things as part of Microsoft and we're shipping features as part of Microsoft products and services, it means that our day to day work does make a real difference for real people around the world.

## Program Manager's primary resposibility
As a program manager the primary responsibility of the role is to represent the voice of the customer. Even though program managers can and do write code, they can and do communication, both inbound and outbound communication, the most important thing that a program manager will do, is to represent the needs of the customer, so that as the features are being built and tested and shipped and supported by the engineering team that works with the program manager, at every point along the way the program manager is representing why we're doing what we're doing; how it's important, how it will be used and ensuring that that customer perspective that the voice and the needs of the customer are represented every step along the way 

## What a Program Manager does?
if we think about what the program
management discipline entails, even
though there's probably as many answers
to this as there are program managers at
Microsoft, a wise man told me years ago, and to be fair a wise man told someone
that I was working with and that person
told me... well we'll go back to the
original wise person the wise person
once said that a program manager is part
developer so if we you know picture the
top of the triangle here part developer
because the program manager needs to
have an informed technical perspective
even though a program manager is
unlikely to be writing code that
actually ships as part of their product
it's very common for program managers to
do prototype code or proof-of-concept
code or at the bare minimum to be able
to understand what it is that their
developers, the engineers that are
shipping and rewriting and shipping the
features, what it is that they're doing
to implement the features that the
program manager has envisioned without
that deep technical foundation the
program manager would be challenged in
those engineering or architectural
conversations even if you're not doing
the work you need to understand that
technical work that's being done. 

## Organization skills
If we look at that triangle go back to that
triangle of the program management
discipline if development or engineering
is one aspect, project management is
another. Now, this is a key part of the
job because as you're going from start
to finish as you're defining and
designing and shipping new capabilities
you need to have the rigor and the
discipline to ensure that the things
that need to be done are being done that
they're being validated that they have
the right quality and in order to do
that a lot of the role of the program
manager
comes down to that organization and
discipline that is traditional for
project managers. It's important to state
you don't need to be a rock star project
manager you don't need to be super
organized to be very successful as a
program manager, but you do need to have
these skills in order to succeed. 

## Communication skills
the third aspect of those the triumvirate of
skills the triangle view of a program
manager is communication. Now, when this
was originally shared with me they'd
actually said not communication but
marketing they said to me or my friend
said to me you're part engineer your
part project manager and you're part
marketer and this comes down to the fact
that you need the ability to communicate
the importance of your feature the value
the impact that your feature will have
but marketing is just one specific type
of communication. 

## Listening skills
A successful program
manager needs to be able to listen to
what customers need to understand not
just what they're asking for but why
they're asking to understand that the
pain that they're feeling because they
don't have your of your your incredible
new future feature and how you can
design and deliver a feature that's part
of a product that doesn't only solve one
person or one customers problems but it
solves a category of problems that can
have a large impact for a greater number
of people in different scenarios. 

## A combination of skills
So if
we think about what the program
management discipline or the program
management role is, in some ways it's the
combination of software development
project management and communication. And
depending on the individual PM, depending
on the team that they're on, and
depending on where they are on a given
project or effort the importance of
these different skills or criteria will
change over time and on each of these
dimensions.

## Why I like to be a Program Manager?
For me personally the
greatest joy of being a program manager
is being able to see
thing end-to-end. 

### Engage and understand customers needs
As a program
manager I have the ability first and
foremost to engage with customers to
understand their problems. Before I start coming up with ideas
for things to do I want to talk to
customers through you know there's
there's lots of channels that are
available so don't stress the details
here just yet it will vary from team to
team but I can talk to customers and
understand what they're doing today
where they're their current tasks and
their current tools are frustrating to
them how much time they're wasting or
how much workarounds they're doing to
work around the challenges or the gaps
in the current product with a current
process and based on all of this
understanding of the problem, I can start
to hypothesize what a solution looks
like. 

This is very iterative but I
can essentially talk to customers to see
where they're struggling I can get
deeper information about what the actual
opportunity is and with that I can have
an informed idea about the solution.

Before I build it I'll go back and I'll
validate it with those customers and
probably with other customers as well to
make sure that it is generalizable and
our understanding of the problem is
complete enough to ship something. 

## Design the product or the feature
Once that's done we'll come up with a design
and the program manager will work with
developers and architects to come up
with both a functional spec and a
technical spec, so we basically have what
the solution or what the feature will
look like, and then the program manager
will work with the developers and the
architects as well, to actually guide the
implementation end to end. There will
always be questions that need that
customer perspective that the PM
represents and making sure that from the
time we have the idea to the time that
we design a solution to the time that
the implementation is complete, it's the
program managers responsibility at each
step along the way to ensure that
everyone knows why we're doing it and
how customers will get value from it how
is it going to be used.

The program manager will make sure that
the feature the new capability the
product is ready for release and as part
of that readiness process this may
involve things like documentation it may
involve things like having focus groups
or running a private preview to get
early customers evaluating and kicking
the tires and providing feedback to make
sure not only does it say what the
developers say that it will do but also
that it does what the customers needed
to do to solve the problems that it was
designed to solve. 

## Ship the product
Once that feature is available a new product is shipped or
a new feature or capability is added to
a service through the ongoing release
cycle. it's the program managers joy it's
the program managers responsibility to
also evangelize and to make sure that
people know here's the thing that we've
shipped stop doing things the old way or
if you had this problem now you can have
this new solution to it, part of this
will be in feature but for me this could
often involve things like user groups or
webcasts or conference presentations.

## Public speaking
Being a program manager even though it
can be a very technical role, and you're
working with all you know a bunch of
other geeks building and shipping these
exciting things, if you're interested in
a more public aspect to the role there's
always an opportunity for people who are
strong on the communication side to go
out there and to represent their
products on stage in front of dozens or
hundreds or thousands of people. For people that are interested
in such things it's a great opportunity
one aspect of shipping products as a
Microsoft PM, I mentioned earlier that
it's that you're making lives better you're
improving the lives of many people
around the world a corollary of this or
another aspect of this is that people
care about what you're doing being a
p.m. at Microsoft you can also be the
public face of your features
and this means that when you blog when
you have a webcast or a podcast or other
public communication there's an audience
out there that is eager to know what
you're doing what you're working on and
how would the thing that you shipped can
work and that community aspect of things
can be very fulfilling and validating as
well 

## People and processes
As with many things the program
management role comes down to people and
process and technology but at least in
my experience the people aspect of being
a program manager is really at the core
of things. You work with customers to
understand their problems and what would
need to happen to solve those problems.
You work with engineers to make sure
that you're building and shipping
features that solve the problems but do
it in a technically efficient, well
performing, cost-effective way. You may
work with designers that will that will
build a user interface that is intuitive
and useful and flows in his modern you
work with fellow program managers you're
never working in isolation you're always
part of the team with people that will
support you and compliment you and help
you grow in your career. You're
working with other teams as well even
though this is something that you do
more as you are more senior in your
career, working with people from other
teams or other orgs or other parts of
Microsoft it's a huge opportunity, and
even though you will start with one team
so you start on one team working on one
product, typically at Microsoft after two
or three years you'll you will have
solved the problems that you came in to
solve you've shipped the features that
you are that you came in to ship, so
you've come in you've made a difference
you've grown...once you've solved the
problems for today Microsoft has this
amazing field of opportunity where you
can look around and find other problems
and other teams and that work that
you've done, the cross team work that
you've done, shipping your first set or
your next set of features and
capabilities it allows you to build
relationships and friendships to find
where your
next opportunity will be. Even though
this sounds I sound like a recruiter as
I listen to myself that sounds like a
pitch my experience has been very much
like that, where as I moved from role to
role and from work to org it's the
people that I worked with three years
ago or five years ago or ten years ago,
that I find myself working with again on
new products under new leaders shipping
new things. 
It always comes back to
who are the customers, because the people
the process and the technology the
customers are always the most important
people. 

Let's go back to the beginning of
the video so the reason that I'm here in
front of the camera with the lights and
the microphone is because my friend
Christopher reached out to me and he
basically said: "Hey! Ee're
looking for a video what it's like to be
a tech PM now imagine you were about to
graduate from college what would you
want to know and the first thing that I
thought of there was well I've never
graduated from college so how would I
know that right so I do not have a
degree I've been with Microsoft for
around 12 years I've been in industry
for about 25 but I was a lousy student,
so if you are coming to Microsoft with a
degree with a CS or other degree you'll
definitely have a step up but what I
wanted to do was I wanted to reach out
to people on my team or on teams that I
worked with on a regular basis, to make
sure that it wasn't just my voice being
reflected so let's actually head over to
teams and see what a few of my peers had
to say about their experience as PMS at
Microsoft.

Let's see
right so when I was done filming the
last section of the videos when I was
done filming my part I reached out to
two members of the power bi team I
reached out to Tessa and I reached out
to Will. There at different stages of
their career with different roles and
responsibilities but they're both
program managers and I asked them three
basic questions. 

The first one I asked
was what do you do as a p.m. at
Microsoft so I didn't say what the
question meant but basically what what
do you do I look after a particular
particular set of features in a future
area most of my role since we are a
product team is that we work with as a
p.m. I work with engineers designers
user researchers and data scientists and
talk to customers and try to synthesize
all of this information to better
understand the functional spec of a
future and in addition to this part of
that figuring out what the function spec
looks like is also taking to account
costs and timelines and figuring out
what milestones you can deliver a
feature in incremental e so they can get
early user feedback and get customers
working with parts of a solution as you
drive the more complete feature to
production. 

I am what's called a group
program manager which means I manage a
surpise I'm team leader or they were put
to me and my specific area is a tool
called power bi desktop which is a tool
for people to bring data together build
visualizations analyze their data and
find interesting insights in that data
and so my day-to-day role it's partly
supervisory in that I've got other
people who are doing lots of the detail
work but I do get to do some of that as
well and for a p.m. that means often
sitting in meetings and debating with
other people other engineers or
designers or whoever they might be how
best do we go and you know
design a feature build a feature to to
serve whatever request it is that's
coming in from our customers. So for
me that means thinking about what does a
customer me at need and deciding how's
this feature gonna work when I click on
this button what is he gonna do
you know if if something goes wrong how
we're gonna tell the use of it goes
wrong what does it say in those error
messages you know what what what things
do we put on a screen for somebody to
click on the or drag or interact with to
helps them analyze that data helps them
find insights in that data

The second question that I asked was what is the
most important skill behavior or
practice that makes you successful as a
program manager at Microsoft

I think it's hard to limit it down to one
particular skill or one that would be
more important than others I think some
of the common ones that people talk
about are having clear communication and
being organized but as I feel like I
start to settle into the role more
sometimes I feel like the most important
skill at the point in time can vary
depending on where I am in the life
cycle of different projects but some
things that I've been thinking about
more recently are being flexible as far
as come up or plans change in your
semester planning and another thing I've
been thinking about law is as PMS we do
have a lot of meetings with different
sometimes context switching can be a
little bit difficult and I definitely
think it's a skill to practice and get
we're used to
